Experimental OpenDDR implementation for PHP

Collaborating

We use the [git-flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Development is done on ```develop``` branch. ```master``` branch should always be in production-ready state. 

Unit testing
------------
To run the testsuite:

    $ cd tests
    $ phpunit
